Manipulates minecraft textures
## Instructions
1) You'll need to go to `%appdata%/.minecraft/versions`, select the version you want to manipulate textures, select the .jar file and use WinRAR with the option `extract to <foldername>/...`<br/>
2) Cut the extracted folder into your desktop.<br/>
3) Open the program, choose the extracted folder as your source folder, create a new folder on your desktop and select it as the save folder.<br/>
4) Change settings as you wish, then select "create resource pack". If the program freezes there's no need to worry, simply wait.<br/>
5) After that, cut the save folder to your minecraft resource pack folder and you're done.
